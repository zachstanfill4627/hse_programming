# HSE Programming

Welcome to the HSE Programming class! This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of programming, equipping you with the skills to create your own software applications.

## Getting Started

Throughout this class, we will leverage online development environments to write, test, and execute our code. These platforms offer a seamless experience, allowing you to focus on learning without the hassle of complex setups.

## Resources

We'll primarily be using the following resources for our programming endeavors:

* **Java Development:** [https://www.online-java.com/](https://www.online-java.com/)
* **Python Development:** [https://www.online-python.com/](https://www.online-python.com/)

Feel free to explore these platforms and familiarize yourself with their interfaces.

## Important Notes

* **Code Execution:** When you click the "Run" button, please be patient. It may take a few moments for your code to compile and execute, especially for larger programs.

* **Experimentation:** Don't hesitate to modify and experiment with the code examples provided. The best way to learn programming is through hands-on practice.

* **Section Scratch Files:** Make use of the Section Scratch code files to test snippets of code and work on your assignments within the online environments.

Let's embark on this exciting programming journey together! If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties along the way, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.

Happy coding!
