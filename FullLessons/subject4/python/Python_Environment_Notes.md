# Python Environments Notes

Need python3.10-venv package installed on the system (Already done in HSE learning environment)

### Setting up a Python Environment:
Within the Python Directory for any given week, run the following:
```bash
python3 -m venv pyenv
```

Once the Python Virtual Environment has been created, you will need to activate it
```bash
source ./pyenv/bin/activite
```

You will notice your bash prompt should have changed. 

When you want to run your python code, you will then execute it like this
```bash
python Section4Lesson.py
```

OR

```bash
python Section4AutomatedLights.py
```

OR

```bash
python Section4StarWars.py
```
