# Activity 1: Whiteboarding a simple Object - Subject Animal (NO CODE)

# name = "";                 # Bingo, Bluey, Bandit, Chilli
# classification = "";       # mammal, reptile, fish, bird
# commonType == "";          # dog, cat, goldfish, kangaroo

# age = 0;                   # ???
# movementSpeedMph = 0.0;    # 14.7     ???
# friendlyStatus = true;     # true / false


#Activity 2: Discussion of simple objects helper methods (NO CODE)

# Name + movementSpeedMph                Ex: Bingo can move at top speed of 14.7 MPH
# Name + age + commonType                Ex: Bluey is a dog

# Activity 4: Concating String Variables
myGreeting = "Hi, my name is"
myName = "Zach Stanfill"
print(myGreeting + " " + myName)
