    // Activities

    // ACTIVITY 1: Class discussion (NO CODE) - Think of things that we could use loops?
    //  - Think about our day, its typically organized and structured the same every day
    //  - Think about simpler things like eating - Food on plate, spoon to food, spoon to mount
    //  - Think about putting on our shoes

    // ACTIVITY 2: Class discussion (NO CODE) - Explain in basic terms the difference between
    //                                          FOR and WHILE loops and when to use them
    //   - FOR loops know the number of loops before starting
    //   - WHILE loops typically determine when to stop based on something that breaks the loop

    // ACTIVITY 3: Class Game - Jenga

    // ACTIVITY 4: Try it out - Lets look the updated Home Lights Automation code
      // 1. How many loop statements are there in the Automated Lights code?
         //  - There is 1 WHILE loop that starts on line 42 and ends on Line 89
      // 2. Why did we choose the looping method we did?
         //  - Because this is for home automation and realistically would never stop looping

    // ACTIVITY 5: Try it out - Lets checkout and run our MazeSolver code
      // Although the logic is more complex that what we have seen so far, we can see that
      // through the use of Loops and Conditionals, we can make a character move around a
      // two-dimensional map from a starting point to an ending point.

    // ACTIVITY 6: Come up with a unique use case for Looping that we see in our normal day
